## Notice
This program is a playlist builder built and designed to work with Spotify. With that in mind, you should have a Spotify account before you try to use this app. (Alternatively, you can just "borrow" someone else's account for a bit. But, that's on you.) 

## Use:
- From the command line/terminal, run "npm run start" anywhere in the Jamming folder
- After a moment, it should launch the app in your browser
- The first time it's loaded, the app will automatically redirect you to a login page for Spotify
- After logging into Spotify, enter a song, artist, or album name in the search bar and click "Search"
- Click the "+" icon next to any song you want to add to your playlist--repeat search and add new songs as necessary
- If you want to remove a song that you added to the playlist, click on the "-" icon
- You can change the name of your playlist to whatever you like--or leave it as the default, it's up to you
- Once you have your playlist setup, click on "Save to Spotify" button--your playlist will clear out, you can now make another playlist or just close the app
